Ma. Lenette Gonzales

I want to learn coding to improve my skills and open new career opportunities. This bootcamp is a great chance for me to gain hands-on experience and understand the basics of web development.

I am a business owner running a printing services business, handling customer orders, production, and overall management. Alongside this, I work as an administrative specialist, performing tasks such as data entry, bookkeeping, and other administrative duties.
